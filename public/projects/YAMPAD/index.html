  	<h1> YAMPad</h1>
	<p>A 6 buttom macropad that runs KMK firmware </p>
    <p>YAMPad is the name of a macropad I designed for the Hack Club YSWS Highway, which gave grants for hardware projects.</p>
<h2>How did I make it?</h2>
<p>When I was making this project, I originally was going to add a rotary encoder, and use QMK. I decided to get rid of the encoder, and use KMK becuase I have had trouble getting QMK firmwares to work, and I couldn't figure out how to get a encoder to work with QMK. By the time I switched to KMK, I had already finished routing the PCB without the encoder, and I didn't want to have to redo the whole thing so I just went with it and went with 6 keys and <em>no</em> encoder.</p>
