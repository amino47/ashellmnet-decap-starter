## What is this site?
This site is my personal website/blog that I code from scratch.

## How did I build this?
I built this using the 11ty static site builder + using some code from the smol 11ty template from 11tyrocks.com. I heavily modifed that code, along with adding my own, to create this site.

## What makes this site special?
One of the major reasons I wrote this from scratch is the fact that I wanted to implement webmentions and microformats2 support. There weren't very many templates that satified my requirements, so I decided to build it myself.
